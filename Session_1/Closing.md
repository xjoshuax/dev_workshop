# Wrap-up of Session 1

Today we've covered a lot of ground. You learned how to operate your file system from the command line and how to synchronize your changes with a source control repository on Github.

Now, for a little taste of next session:

1. Using `cd`, point the terminal, to Session_1/
2. Run the command `swift finish.swift`
3. See you next time!
