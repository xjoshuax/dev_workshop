# Intro to Programming
(for non-devs working at a tech startup)


## What is this?
The name of this workshop maybe a little bit misleading as the focus is not only on programming but on overall technology stack that's usually involved in a tech startup.
By taking part on this workshop, or reading the tutorials, students are not expected to have any previous knowledge in software development. By the end of it, students will have a pretty good notion of the technology stack behind a mobile-focused startup and will be able to experience all aspects of developing software.

## Why does this exist?
The internet is full of resources to learn how to code. But I feel like the mindset necessary for people working on tech startups should be less focused on programming and more focused on understanding how things work together. Even though this workshop will have a deep focus on understanding the basics of programming it will also show how to piece together versioning, web technologies and mobile development into one single project.

## Who is this for?
 - You work at a mobile-focused startup
 - Programming is not a main part of your role
 - You want to experience the inner-workings of the technology that makes your business possible.

## Structure
This workshop is being structured to be presented in 4 different after-work sessions and to be presented by a developer to the students. But I'll do my best to make all the material also available as self-paced tutorials.

### 1st session
 - Getting familiar with the command line
 - How Git works
 - How a web application works

### 2nd session
 - How a mobile application works
 - Introduction to programming with Swift

### 3rd session
 - How a web application works part II
 - More programming with Swift

### 4th session
 - Wrapping up our mobile app
 - Publishing our backend

## Where to go from here?
If you're just starting the workshop, open SETUP.md and follow the instructions there.

If you finished the workshop and are interested in more self-learning material, here's some references.

 - [Code 4 Startup](https://code4startup.com/): A website where you learn how to build apps by cloning existing successful existing apps (Airbnb, Tinder, Etsy, etc.) It's less in-depth coding and more in-breadth setting up different technologies in a stack to make a full product functional.
 - [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/): Free programming lessons with a gamefied approach. When you reach a certain level you'll receive real features requested by real entities (non-profit) to be implemented. It's a chance to learn in-depth coding skills and make a social difference.
 - [A Better Way to Learn Swift](https://thinkster.io/a-better-way-to-learn-swift): In-depth tutorial on the Swift language.
 - [Nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/): Interactive tutorials to deepen your understanding of Node.js
 - [More Resources](http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html) Don't open if you're offended with curse words. Despite its crude name, the site as a huge list of free programming resources in multiple languages
